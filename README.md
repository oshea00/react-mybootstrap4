# React Examples
This repo contains a number of experiments and examples using React and a number of third-party APIs for visualization: ThreeJS, eCharts and Bootstrap 4 so far.

## Last Cool Thing
The TreeChart component example was fun to do and provides a pretty good pattern for displaying tree-like data using eCharts. See src/components/TreeChart.js

## Previous Cool Thing
The PhoneScene component example shows how to use Three.js to display 3D models - in this case an iPhone6 using React.
